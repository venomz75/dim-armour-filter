A tool that generates a DIM (Destiny Item Manager) search string based on user supplied parameters to easily filter armour.

Users are able to choose filters and enter stats to generate a DIM query to filter their armour collection. Current options include: class, exotic, masterwork and piece type filtering. These are used in conjunction with the base stats to find armour pieces with the same or greater base stats than the values entered.

This makes it easy to find similar or better rolls to a good piece of armour you just got, making it quicker and easier to decide if its worth sharding or keeping.
